    "description": "nRide is developing a peer-to-peer ride-hailing protocol that connects riders and drivers directly, eliminating intermediaries. By removing middlemen, nRide aims to reduce fees and increase transparency, while also creating a more equitable platform for drivers and riders. Additionally, nRide solves the problem of isolated user bases by providing a standardized way for ride-hailing applications to connect with each other and access a larger user base, fostering a more open and competitive marketplace",
